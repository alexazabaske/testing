Okay, I think I'm getting the hang of this. I just need to figure out the difference between pull, checkout, and merge...

I'm changing this one in the github online. 
Another edit from the terminal right hereeeee
^ I edited this line, but I didn't add it to the staging area. So I didn't commit it or push it to the remote
I was still able to commit & push other files to the remote,  and pull from the remote, without erasing that line. 

Now I'm going to committ all changes in this working directory to the remote github repo.
